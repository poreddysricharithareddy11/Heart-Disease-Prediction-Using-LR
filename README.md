**Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression**


  Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection and risk prediction can be crucial in improving patient outcomes. In this blog, we will walk you through the process of using logistic regression to predict the risk of heart disease in patients. We will use the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which contains valuable information on cardiovascular risk factors. By the end of this blog, you will have a clear understanding of how to prepare the data, build a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and gain insights from model coefficients.

**Objective**:

 Build a logistic regression model to predict the risk of heart disease in patients.
